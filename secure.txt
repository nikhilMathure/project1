[200~We import Flask and create a Flask application.
We define a dictionary users to store hardcoded username-password pairs. In a real application, you'd replace this with a database.
We create a /login endpoint that accepts POST requests.
In the login function, we retrieve the JSON data from the request, which should contain a username and password.
We check if the username and password are provided, and if not, return a 400 Bad Request response.
We then check if the provided username exists in the users dictionary and if the password matches. If not, we return a 401 Unauthorized response.
If the credentials are valid, we return a 200 OK response with a "Login successful" message.
